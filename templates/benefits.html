                    <p>Kangen Water is a concept developed by Enagic, a Japanese company specialising in water ionisation technology.</p>
                    <p>This water is produced through a process called electrolysis, which separates ordinary water into acidic and alkaline components using an ionisation machine. Kangen Water refers to the alkaline portion, which typically has a pH level between 8 and 9.5, making it more alkaline than standard tap water, which usually has a neutral pH of around 7.</p>
